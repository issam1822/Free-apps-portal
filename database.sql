However, some Internet sites block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions.<br><br>VPNs cannot make online connections completely anonymous, but they can usually increase privacy and security. To prevent disclosure of private information, VPNs typically allow only authenticated remote access using tunneling protocols and encryption techniques.<br><br>Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points. Mobile VPNs have been widely used in public safety, where they give law enforcement officers access to mission-critical applications, such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network.', '1661042163167.webp', 'thunder-vpn', '5.3M', 'Free', 'Signal Lab', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.free.unblock.thunder.vpn', NULL, '2', '4.00', '', 1, 0, 0, 19, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, '2019-11-06 20:19:54', '2022-08-15 14:55:20'),

Hibernation is gently and efficient way to save your battery and increase performance.<br><b><i> Root Booster will find battery draining and performance demanding applications and auto hibernates them.</i></b><br><br><b>CPU (processor governor control) </b><br>A governor is a driver for the  regulation of CPU frequency. Governor decides how fast and when will be achieved maximal or minimal CPU frequency. Setting appropriate governor makes your device more battery saving, fast or even more stable. However, deciding which governor is suitable is a little bit tricky. <br><b><i>Root Booster can decide which governor you should use and automatically applies the most suitable governor for the selected mode.</i></b><br><br><b>RAM (memory manager)</b><br>Each application uses VM heap for it \'s data and work. The main reason to change the VM heap size is stability improvement. Many big applications need a big amount of memory (VM heap) for their work. If the VM heap size is smaller than the requested memory, it causes an application crash (Out of memory error). Setting heap size is hard task and there is no manual to set up for better performance. Better performance can be only achieved by testing. <br><b><i>Root booster will test your RAM and sets up your VM heap size for better stability and performance.</i></b><br><br><b>New version for non-rooted users</b><br><br><b>System Cleaner</b><br>Cleans empty folders, gallery thumbnails and uninstalled apps trash to speed up<br>your device and free up your storage.<br><br><b>Hibernation</b><br>Hibernation disables and freezes apps running in the background to improve battery life<br>and purify your device.<br><br><b>Cache Cleaner</b><br>Each app creates unnecessary files that use your SD card or internal storage<br>space.

Anything you send or receive on your mobile devices on public WiFi can be intercepted, which makes your personal information such as your passwords, pictures, app data and other private information vulnerable to hackers. <br><br>Touch VPN automatically turns public WiFi into safe and secure private WiFi. Your mobile security, privacy and personal information will be protected from hackers, identity theft, and other malicious activities when we detect a public WiFi network. <br><br>Touch VPN is powered by one of the most trusted privacy, security and access provider - Hotspot Shield.<br><br><b>Highlights of Touch VPN:</b><br><br><b>✓ Free: </b> 100% free. No credit card information needed. No trials offered.<br><b>✓ Unlimited: </b> Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations.  <br><b>✓ Simple: </b> Unblock the world with just one touch of the “Connect” button. <br><b>✓ Secured: </b>  Our strong SSL encryption will make you fully anonymous and secured.<br><b>✓ Support: </b> If you have any feedback or suggestions, please send an email to: support@northghost.com!<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br><b>■ What is a VPN</b><br><br>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to the server in another country. Because of the encryption process the data cannot be filtered or blocked. If you live in Sweden for example, when connect to a VPN server in US, your traffic would look like coming from the United States, instead of Sweden. <br><br><b>■ Why using a VPN</b><br><br>With a VPN, you are not only able to unblock geo-restricted or censored services, such as Facebook, Pandora and Youtube; your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web completely anonymously.<br><br><b>■ VPN vs. Proxy</b><br><br>VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic and change your IP. A Proxy server is however, completely browser based, whether you are using Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic, and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online freedom, privacy and security.<br><br><b>■ Why Touch VPN</b><br><br>Touch VPN is 100% free, unlimited, secured and super easy to use. You can connect to any of the servers below (Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, United States, Netherlands, and Canada) to enjoy unlimited online privacy and freedom.

Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection.<br><br><b>⇨ Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. </b> Touch VPN contains only one button.

Other languages will be added, but we are a tiny company with a very large game).', NULL, NULL, 'Vendetta Online is a free, graphically intensive and cross-platform MMORPG set in space. Players take the role of spaceship pilots in a vast, persistent online galaxy. Trade between stations and build an empire, or pirate traders who dare to pursue routes through areas of lawless space. Fight other players, or cooperate with friends to push back the mysterious Hive. Mine ores and minerals, gather resources, and craft unusual items. Join the military of your nation, and participate in massive online battles (see the trailer). A wide variety of gameplay styles are available, from the the intensity of huge battles and realtime PvP, to the low-key enjoyment of quiet trading and mining in less dangerous areas of the galaxy. Play the style of game that suits you, or that suits your current mood. The availability of relatively casual and short-term goals allows for fun when only a little time is available to play.<br><br>Vendetta Online is free-to-play on Android, up to a level cap. An optional low subscription cost of only $1 per month allows unified access across all available platforms (including PC, Win/Mac/Linux). The Android version includes several helpful features:<br><br>- Single-Player mode: after completing the tutorial, a single-player sandbox sector becomes available, letting you perfect your flying technique and enjoy minigames while offline. This feature will be expanded in future patches, and will permanently be available to anyone with the game installed. Enjoy!<br>- Game controllers, TV Mode: use your favorite gamepad to play, Moga, Nyko, PS3, Xbox, Logitech and others. Gamepad-oriented \"TV Mode\" is enabled on micro-console and set-top box devices like AndroidTV.<br>- Keyboard and Mouse support (no FPS-style mouse on Android).<br><br>Additionally, be aware of the following:<br><br>- Free download, no strings attached.. find out if the game is for you.<br>- Seamlessly switch between mobile and PC! Play the game on your Mac, Windows, or Linux machine when at home. Single universe for all platforms.<br><br>System Requirements:<br><br>- Dual-core 1Ghz+ ARMv7 device, running a minimum of Android 2.3. We recommend Tegra4, Adreno 320+, Mali T6 and PowerVR Series 6 GPUs.<br>- 500MB of free SD space recommended. The game uses about 350MB, but patches itself, so additional free space is advised.<br>- 512MB device RAM minimum, 1GB recommended. This is a graphically intensive game! Anything less may experience force-closes, and is at your own risk.<br>- We suggest installing over Wifi (for the large download), but playing the game should use relatively little bandwidth, and works well over most 3G networks. You are responsible for monitoring your own bandwidth usage.<br>- If you experience a problem, please post to our forums so we can get more information from you. We fix issues as soon as possible, but we simply do not have *every* phone.<br>- Vendetta Online is MOGA Enhanced! Available at major US retailers and online at http://www.powera.com/moga<br><br>Caveats and Additional Information:<br><br>- The hardware intensity of this game often exposes device driver issues that remain hidden with other apps. If your device itself crashes and reboots, it is a driver bug! Not the game!<br>- This is a large and complex game, a true PC-style MMO. Do not expect a \"mobile\" game experience. If you take a little time to read the tutorials, you will succeed at the game much more quickly.<br>- The tablet and handset flight interfaces may take a little time to learn, although they are effective with some experience. The flight UI will be continually improved as we receive user feedback. Keyboard play can also be very effective (Asus Transformer, etc).<br>- We are a continually evolving game, often with patches released weekly.
